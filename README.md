# higher-or-lower
Higher or Lower game written in C++

I am currently learning C++ for University, around 3 weeks into the course.

I've studied Python and Javascript in the past but not massively in depth.

Decided to make a Higher or Lower game using functions, loops, if statements, libraries and data validation.

Any feedback, critiques or pointers would be greatly appreciated!
